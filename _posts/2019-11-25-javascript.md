## JavaScript First Steps ##


## 1. What is JavaScript?
### A high-level definition

JavaScript is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies.

* **HTML** is the markup language that we use to structure and give meaning to our web content, for example defining paragraphs, headings, and data tables, or embedding images and videos in the page.
* **CSS** is a language of style rules that we use to apply styling to our HTML content, for example setting background colors and fonts, and laying out our content in multiple columns.
* **JavaScript** is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. (Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

### So what can it really do?

JS allow you to do things like:

- Store useful values inside variables.
- Operations on piece of test(string).
- Run code in response to certain events occurring on a web page.



**API**  generally fall into two categories:

1. Browser APIs
2. Third party APIs

### What is JavaScript doing on your page?







### How do you add JavaScript to your page?

- Internal JavaScript

```javascript
<script>

  // JavaScript goes here

</script>
```



- External JavaScript

1. First, create a new file in the same directory as your sample HTML file. Call it `script.js` — make sure it has that .js filename extension, as that's how it is recognized as JavaScript.

2. Replace your current <script> element with the following:

   ```html
   <script src="script.js" defer></script>
   ```

   

- Inline JavaScript handlers
