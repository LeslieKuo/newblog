I love Xinhai so much!!!

**Attached please find a styling portrait of Xinhai (sketch style using gaussian filter).**

- Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a  question he wanted to spend his whole life answering.

_I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed.  Turns out it wasn’t something about you at all. It was just you._

- Loving you is the important thing, Miss Lester. There are some people who think love is sex and marriage and six o’clock-kisses and children, and perhaps it is, Miss Lester. But do you know what I think?  I think love is a touch and yet not a touch.
